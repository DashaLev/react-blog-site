It\u2019s freeing to pack up the car and take on the role of the pilot, stopping on a whim or making a detour when something catches your eye.</p><p>According to a 2019 survey by MMGY Global, a marketing firm specializing in travel, hospitality, and entertainment, the great American road trip is enjoying a comeback, with a 64 percent increase since 2015.</p><p>The best part about road trips is that there\u2019s something for everyone \u2014 a transcontinental or multiday road trip isn\u2019t just for college grads or retirees, there\u2019s a route for travelers in every decade of their life.</p><p>To get you started on your next great American road trip, we\u2019ve researched where you should go and what you should do during each decade of your life \u2014 because what you\u2019ll like when you\u2019re a 20-something will be vastly different than what will satisfy you when you\u2019re a 60-something. Of course, these routes are only meant to get the ball rolling. Like any good road trip pilot, feel free to add in stops and side trips that suit you to create your own personalized version of these epic road trips.</p><h2>In your 20s: Pacific Coast Highway</h2><p>Technically, you can make the coastal drive from northern California to San Diego in around 10 hours, but this is not the sort of road trip you\u2019ll want to rush. The Pacific Coast Highway (also known as Highway 1) is one of the most scenic drives in the world, so roll down the windows, enjoy the views, and keep on top of your Instagram story.</p><p>The route leads travelers right along the continental United States\u2019 westernmost coast, where \u201cpull over the car, we need a photo\u201d sunsets are the norm and castles, sea lions, and pebbly beaches are waiting to be discovered.</p><p> You can make the drive down California\u2019s Highway 1 in a day, but for a true road trip, we recommend starting your adventure in Olympia, Washington and ending in San Diego, California, crossing three coastal states along the way. In Olympia, stock up on road trip essentials before heading west until you hit Highway 101 (which eventually leads to California\u2019s Highway 1).</p><p> Before you reach the Oregon border, swing by Cape Disappointment State Park. It\u2019s a great place to camp (or rent a yurt for the night), but you can also get out and stretch your legs on the 1.2-mile Cape Disappointment Trail or the 0.45-mile Benson Beach Trail. If you\u2019re lucky, you may spot an orca in the distance.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<p>In Oregon, swing by the Devil\u2019s Punchbowl State Natural Area. During low tide, you can explore the tide pools and pack along a picnic, but you\u2019ll want to get to higher ground as the tide comes in and the ocean starts slamming and swirling into the natural carved-out bowl. For great photo ops, head to Cape Perpetua Scenic Area or take a hike and catch the sunset at the Samuel H. Boardman State Scenic Corridor.</p><p>When you cross the border into California, it doesn\u2019t take long to link up with Highway 1, the official start of the Pacific Coast Highway.</p><h2>In your 30s: The Loneliest Road</h2><p>Drive through Redwood National and State Parks \u2014 home of the tallest trees on Earth \u2014 and post up on the black-sand beach in King Range National Conservation Area\u2019s Shelter Cove. Further down the road, visit the historic lighthouse in Point Reyes National Seashore before hitting San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge.</p><p>Continuing east, head through the Rocky Mountains, crossing over the Continental Divide. Grab a hearty lunch and more road trip provisions in Salida, Colorado before heading into eastern Colorado and the start of the Great Plains, where you\u2019ll get a healthy dose of Americana landscapes \u2014  small towns, railroad tracks, and water towers.</p><h2>In your 40s: Grand Canyon to Yellowstone to Mount Rushmore</h2><p>This 1,290-mile route takes around 20 hours and includes stops at the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone National Park, and Mount Rushmore. Providing the perfect blend of outdoor activity, family car time, and American history, it makes for the ultimate week-long family road trip.</p><p>Your journey kicks off in Flagstaff, Arizona, just over an hour from Grand Canyon National Park\u2019s South Rim, which is open year-round. In the park, cruise along Desert View Drive and burn off some energy while climbing the 85 steps to the top of the Desert View Watchtower, where you can enjoy 360-degree views of the canyon.</p><h2>In your 50s: The Oregon Trail</h2><p>Entering your 50s marks a transition \u2014 your kids are becoming more independent and your retirement and health are top of mind. It\u2019s a shift that warrants plenty of time to reflect and enjoy the beauty of the U.S. And what better way to achieve that than a transcontinental road trip? The Oregon Trail is a beautiful, roughly 2,000-mile route that connects Missouri to Oregon.</p><p>Just like the pioneers in the mid-1800s, you can start your expedition in Independence, Missouri, making your way west \u2014 although at a much faster pace \u2014 toward Oregon. You\u2019ll pass through the beautiful, expansive Great Plains before stopping in Sioux City, Iowa to get a dose of culture at the Sioux City Art Center. In Nebraska, make a stop at the Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park, a protected area full of fossils.<h2>In your 60s: Route 66</h2><p>The romance of Route 66 is only amplified by driving the aptly named road in your 60s \u2014 even better if you happen to be 66. The route runs from Chicago to Los Angeles, passing through the heart of the U.S. and some notorious roadside stops. Jam \u201cRoute 66\u201d by the Nat King Cole Trio as you zoom by the best of Americana \u2014 from giant neon signs to tiny towns and vacant truck stops.</p><p>Before it became the Route 66 we know today, there was the transcontinental National Old Trails Road, and years later, around World War II, it was a main thoroughfare through small towns across the Midwest and Southwest. During the Great Depression, farmers displaced by the Dust Bowl traveled to California along the route. Today, you\u2019ll get a taste of Route 66\u2019s long history as you pass old-timey diners and motels and plenty of roadside attractions that provide a healthy dose of nostalgia.</p><h2>In your 70s and Beyond: The Atlantic Coast</h2><p>Your 70s are the perfect decade to hit the road and see the sights. The Atlantic Coast road trip starts in New York City and ends with a tranquil drive across the Overseas Highway to Key West \u2014 with plenty of coastal wilderness, beautiful beach resorts, and old fishing villages along the way. The trip is just under 2,000 miles and much of it runs along \u2014 or near \u2014 the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>While in North Carolina, stop to stretch your legs in Wilmington\u2019s downtown. For a taste of nostalgia, visit Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which is home to a boardwalk that\u2019s lined with rides and saltwater taffy shops. If you\u2019re up for a round of golf, or some more beach time, head to Hilton Head Island, then drop down to Savannah, Georgia.</p>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/road_2.png",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/road_3.png",image3:"/react-blog-pr/images/road_4.png",image4:"/react-blog-pr/images/road_5.png",image5:"/react-blog-pr/images/road_6.png",image6:"/react-blog-pr/images/road_7.png",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/road_bg.png"},{id:2,image:"/react-blog-pr/images/parasute.png",date:"12 FEB",category:"LIFESTYLE",author:"A.Tomson",title:"The best places for extreme jumping",text:"People have invented a lot in the search for a source of thrill.

We will tell you about which places on the planet are especially good for getting off the ground in this article. Paragliders, bungee jumping (bungee), skydiving or base jumping (different types of parachuting) replaced the person\u2019s wings.</p><p>I'm glad that You with me, so let see what places on the planet are especially good for taking off from the earth and attractive so many tourists.</p><h2>1. Paragliding</h2><p>A paraglider is a non-powered manned aircraft with a fixed-wing, inflated by air. Flying on it is not very fast, but it is a good opportunity for the paraglider to appreciate the views passing below. Where is it especially nice to soar on a paraglider?</p><h3>Bazaruto Archipelago, Mozambique</h3><p>This archipelago, almost untouched by civilization, is located 750 km from the African continent. Here are white sandy beaches and crystal clear water. Paragliding enthusiasts come here to fly all year round.</p><h3>Tanyang, South Korea</h3><p>Two and a half hours drive from Seoul \u2013 and in front of you is the Asian capital of paragliding. The popular tourist city with beautiful surrounding landscapes is so fond of extreme sports that it even has two runways for paragliders and hang gliders.</p><h3>Dune at Pyla, Gironde, France</h3><p>The largest sand dune and one of the most famous places for paragliding in Western Europe. The sky above the dune in Pyla, located on the shore, is ideal for maneuvering paragliding due to the constant wind blowing from the sea. But due to these special weather conditions, the dune is more suitable for experienced extreme sportsmen, not beginners.</p><h2>2. Bungee jumping</h2><p>Bungee jumping is a popular attraction, which in our country is often called a bungee. Participants are tied to a long rubber rope with which they jump down. A spectacular jump requires a sufficient height and, of course, a beautiful view.</p><h3>Kawarau Bridge,  Queenstown, New Zealand</h3><p>The attraction opened in 2003 and quickly became popular \u2013 almost a million people managed to jump during this time. The fall height is small \u2013 43 meters and they land after jumping directly into the turquoise water of the Kawarau River.</p><h3>Dam on the Versazka River, Ticino, Switzerland</h3><p>On this dam, the moment of James Bond\u2019s fall in the GoldenEye film was filmed. Here they fly in flight from a concrete wall of a dam 220 meters high. Ride and jump can be ordered from specialists.</p><h2>3. Base jumping</h2><p>Base jumping is an extreme sport that uses a special parachute for jumping from rocks, mountains, and high-rise buildings. The lower the object, the more dangerous the landing.</p><h3>Angel Falls, Venezuela</h3><p>The highest (979 meters) waterfall in the world and one of the most beloved base jumpers sites. The flight is accompanied by the roar of a powerful stream of water falling down the steep cliffs and disappearing into the tropical thickets. Bejumping is allowed here by law and special tours are regularly arranged at the waterfall.</p><h3>Navajo Bay, Zakynthos, Greece</h3><p>One of the most beautiful beaches in Greece and the most popular base jumping place in Europe. Jump here from a cliff 200 meters high. The freefall lasts from two to five seconds, and then \u2013 landing in soft sand. There are regularly held rallies of base jumpers.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<h2>4. Skydiving</h2><p>Skydiving (lit. diving into the sky) is a type of parachuting, where free fall is extended due to the fact that the parachute is opened as close to the ground as possible.</p><h3>Dubai, UAE</h3><p>Skydive Dubai is one of the most popular parachute clubs in the world. This official organization, opened with the permission of the sheik, whose son is a fan of skydiving, attracts tourists from all over the world to jump in a beautiful area with a view of the famous man-made island of Palm Jumeirah.</p><h3>Lake Bled, Slovenia</h3><p>The quiet beautiful lake surrounding the island of Bled in Slovenia is one of the most popular places for skydiving in all of Europe due to its picturesque views and easy access.</p><h3>Byron Bay, Australia</h3><p>On the famous Australian beach there is an opportunity to jump with a parachute, looking at the easternmost point of Australia and Byron Bay lighthouse. After the flight, tourists are given four hours of surfing lessons.</p> <img scr=`/react-blog-pr/images/parasute_2.png`>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/parasute_2.png",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/parasute_3.png",image3:"/react-blog-pr/images/parasute_4.png",image4:"/react-blog-pr/images/parasute_5.png",image5:"/react-blog-pr/images/parasute_6.png",image6:"/react-blog-pr/images/parasute_7.png",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/parasute_bg.png"},{id:3,image:"/react-blog-pr/images/places.png",date:"12 FEB",category:"INSPIRATION",author:"J.Stoyn",title:"TOP 10 unusual places in the world",text:"Looking at these photos, it's difficult to imagine that everything is a creation of nature.

We invite you to see this for yourself by planning a trip to one of the places on our list.</p><h2>1. Spotted Lake, British Columbia, Canada</h2><p>Spotted Lake has long been revered by the native Okanagan (Syilx) people and it\u2019s easy to see why they think of it as sacred. In the summer the water of the lake evaporates and small mineral pools are left behind, each one different in colour to the next. The unique lake can be viewed on Highway 3, northwest of the small town of Osoyoos, although visitors are asked not to trespass on tribal land. If you're looking to explore more waters, read our selection of 20 breathtaking lakes around the world to inspire your travels.</p><h2>2. The Giant's Causeway, Northern Ireland</h2><p>Sixty million years ago a huge volcanic eruption spewed out a mass of molten basalt, which then solidified and contracted as it cooled, creating the cracks that can be seen today. There are an estimated 37,000 polygon columns at this World Heritage Site, so geometrically perfect that local legend has it they were created by a giant. It's a firm contender for one of the weirdest places on earth. If you're heading further afield to find some natural wonders, read our selection of the best volcanoes around the world.</p><h2>3. Pamukkale, Turkey</h2><p>A remarkable UNESCO World Heritage Site in southwest Turkey, a visit to Pamukkale (Cotton Palace) also takes in the ancient ruins of Hierapolis, the once great city that was built around it. Water cascades from natural springs and down the white travertine terraces and forms stunning thermal pools perfect for a quick dip. We recommend joining a small group tour to have a guide with you. You may have never heard of Pamukkale in Turkey until now, and you may have never known about these facts about Turkey either.</p><h2>4. The Tianzi mountains, China</h2><p>Found in the northwest of Hunan Province in China, these staggering limestone pinnacles are covered in lush greenery and often shrouded in mist. A cable car goes as far as Huangshi village and from here there are plenty of trails to take in the breathtaking views of Tianzi ('son of heaven'). Unsurprisingly they are the inspiration for the floating mountains in the blockbuster movie Avatar. If you're looking to explore more of what the country has to offer, read about our things not to miss in China.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<h2>5. Socotra Island, Yemen</h2><p>Separated from mainland Africa more than six million years ago, this remote island looks like the set of a sci-fi film. Socotra\u2019s incredible and unique biodiversity means that there are plants and trees here not found anywhere else in the world \u2013 particularly bizarre are the ancient and twisted dragon\u2019s blood tree and the bulbous bottle tree.</p><h2>6. Chocolate Hills of Bohol Island, the Philippines</h2><p>Bohol\u2019s 1700-odd conical hills dot the middle of the island in the Philippines. they range in height but are so regular in shape that they could be mistaken for being man-made. However, according to UNESCO they are the uplift of coral deposits and a result of rainwater erosion. The hills only earn their 'chocolate' nickname in the dry season when the foliage goes from lush green to brown.Consider combining a trip to the Chocolate Hills with a visit to the Tarsier Sanctuary and a lunch cruise along the Loboc River. Bohol Island is just one of our favourite islands in the Philippines. Make sure to head to Olango Island to find migratory birds and try diving on Panago Island.</p><h2>7.  Red Beach, Panjin, China</h2><p>Very cool and very weird, this beach is covered in a type of seaweed called Sueda, which turns bright red in autumn. Thirty kilometres southwest of Panjin, these tidal wetlands are an important nature reserve for migrating birds. Only a small section of the beach is open to the public, but it can be explored via a wooden walkway that stretches out to sea. Red Beach may just be one of China's best secret beaches. Head here quick, along with these other secret beaches around the world before the crowds arrive.</p><h2>8. Plain of Jars, Laos</h2><p>Shrouded in myth, megalithic stone jars are scattered across Xieng Khouang Province in groups from one to one hundred. A working theory is that the huge cylindrical jars were used in ancient funeral ceremonies, though local legend has it that the jars were used to brew rice wine for giants. In the 1960s Northern Laos was subject to a massive aerial bombardment by the USA and it\u2019s only been relatively recently that some areas have been cleared and declared safe for visitors.</p><h2>9. Goblin Valley State Park, Utah, USA</h2><p>No, this is not Mars but an uninhabited valley 216 miles southeast of Salt Lake City in Utah. Soft sandstone has, for many years, been eroded by wind and water to form strange pinnacles or hoodoos that some think resemble goblins. The eerie landscape is only about a mile across and two miles long and it\u2019s well worth exploring the marked trails to get up close to the bizarre formations.Also relatively unknown is the fact that you can go on a spectacular canyoneering adventure in the Valley of Goblins. Looking for more outdoor adventures in Utah? Why not stargaze in Antelope Island State Park?</p><h2>10.  Glass Beach, California, USA</h2><p>This glittering sea glass beach in California is a remarkable side effect of years of rubbish being dumped on the beach. It wasn\u2019t until the 1960s that this was stopped and by then the sea was full of everything from electrical appliances to bottles and cans. Over time, the waves broke everything down into colourful pebbles and the beach became a major tourist attraction \u2013 now ironically under threat because visitors are taking home the glass. It's not all glass on the beaches in the state! Here are the best 10 beaches in California if you're looking for sun, sea and sand.</p>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_2.png",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_3.png",image3:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_4.png",image4:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_5.png",image5:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_5_1.png",image6:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_6.png",image7:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_7.png",image8:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_8.png",image9:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_9.png",image10:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_10.png",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/places_bg.png"},{id:4,image:"/react-blog-pr/images/photo.png",date:"12 FEB",category:"PHOTOGRAPHY",author:"A.Tomson",title:"Amazing photography examples around the world",text:"An amazing photography fully expresses your feelings and making people comfortable to pose is a wonderful achievement.",fullTextPartOne:"An amazing photography fully expresses your feelings and making people comfortable to pose is a wonderful achievement.

Buying dresses for yourself is another matter entirely. Moreover, if only the middle and lower segment of the mass market is available for money, it is very easy to choose an unsuccessful dress. In stores or catalogs, they can present even the weirdest and most unsuccessful ideas in the best possible light. And it seems that this dress, which sits so well on a mannequin or looks in a catalog frame, is exactly what you need. And it seems that here he has - the characteristic signs of current trends. We must take. But then, putting on this dress - you feel that something is still wrong with it. And it still differs from fashionable current models. As a result, such a thing hangs in the closet, not finding use. You tried to save money, and the money wasted.</p><p class='italic-font'>How can you avoid making such a mistake? It is meticulous to evaluate the dress you are about to buy. What makes a budget store unsuccessful? Attempts of designers to \u201ctwist\u201d the trend in the most economical mode. As a result, fashionable silhouettes are made from cheap fabrics that do not hold the shape of such silhouettes. The poor quality of the materials is compensated by the decor. Not actual prints copied from the collections of previous seasons are used. And so on.</p><p class='bolt-font'>I found several dresses that can be used to make out the most important mistakes of bad dresses:</p><p>1. The most \u201cslippery\u201d moment today is <span>sheath dresses</span>. They were incredibly popular a few years ago. And, in principle, for some professions they still remain practically uniforms. But it's very easy to look bad with a dress like this. First, the case must have a perfect fit. Otherwise, the dress plays against you. Secondly, if you want a sheath dress, choose laconic models with a minimum of decor. The model as in the picture - with several types of polka-dot patterns, straps, and even made of knitwear - is clearly an unsuccessful choice.</p><p>2. <span>Floral print</span> is on trend. And even the drawing itself is not so bad on this .dress. But the dress itself seems too simple. Everything is too much for him. Too short length, too childish, too small a sleeve, too small gathers under the yoke, and so on. It looks more like a nightgown.</p><p>3. The <span>long dress wiht open sholders</span> looks very pretty. Like a red carpet outfit literally. But alas, in life it will look rather strange. Why? For an ordinary summer dress, it is too pretentious and open, too \u201cceremonial\u201d in appearance. For a formal dress, it is made of too simple material. Polyester knitwear will stretch, the neckline will quickly lose its beautiful shape (such complex draperies look better when they are made of dense structural fabrics such as dense silk or satin, and even then they often require additional duplication of details). In general, the problem with all such maxi dresses is that they seem to be unable to decide whether it is just a summer light dress, or an evening outfit. As a result, the only place where it will be appropriate is a photo session, where post-processing can, if necessary, hide some of the flaws in the material.</p><p>4. <span>Dresses with open shoulders and lace</span> were at their peak the summer before last. But even then he would not have had enough expressiveness. In dresses of this type, one emphasis should be made. Or it will be a print - and then all attention will be focused on it. Either it will be an idea of romance, and then the main thing is lace and a flying frill along the top. Both the first and the second should be wider and more voluminous. In the same case, the manufacturer decided to save on materials, so he tried to combine the print with narrow lace in an attempt to save the situation.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<p>5. An idea that should be left far in the past - all kinds of <span> \u201ctrickery\u201d</span>, especially made using digital prints. What we see in the picture would look interesting if it was really a combination of a striped dress and a denim vest. Then the image would have volume and expressiveness. But as a print on knitwear, it looks flat and uninteresting. Especially considering that the back of such a dress has no pattern at all.</p><p>6. <span>All the trendy ideas of this and last season are clearly read in this dress</span>. But just as well the manufacturer's savings are read. The dress is not long enough, the sleeve is not wide enough, the frills are too narrow, they also regretted the material on the ribbon to make a chic bow. The very case when it seems to you that you are buying a trendy stylish thing, but in fact this is some kind of nonsense.</p><p>7. It is very important to remember <span>the combination of print and material</span>. This flower dress is made of jersey. And this is already an unfortunate choice of material, which immediately brings us associations with knitted diapers for babies or dressing gowns for grandmothers. Small floral print looks good on light flying fabrics. Such as chiffon, for example. Sometimes it looks good on cotton, but here a lot depends on the quality of the material, otherwise it will also look more like an inexpensive sheet.</p><p>8. The problem with inexpensive dresses (although it must be admitted that this is sometimes found in expensive ones) is that, trying to save money, the manufacturer <span>makes cutting without taking into account the print</span>. As a result, the position of the pattern and the cut lines crossing this pattern represent the figure in a non-winning light. For example, here the waistline makes the figure wider. Although, it would seem, a dress with a wrap should be slim. But this only works if the dress's shelves are one-cut, and not cut off at the waist</p>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/dresses_2.png",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/dresses_3.png",image3:"/react-blog-pr/images/dresses_4.png",image4:"/react-blog-pr/images/dresses_5.png",image5:"/react-blog-pr/images/dresses_6.png",image6:"/react-blog-pr/images/dresses_7.png",image7:"/react-blog-pr/images/dresses_8.png",image8:"/react-blog-pr/images/dresses_9.png",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/dresses_bg.png"},{id:6,image:"/react-blog-pr/images/ashraful.png",date:"03 MAR",category:"PHOTOGRAPHY",author:"J.Stoyn",title:"Delightful photographs of Ashraful Arefin",text:"Today we will be recharged with positive energy from the delightful photography of Ashraful Arefin, a talented 31-year-old photographer and digital artist based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Unfortunately, in our pursuit of success we often take shortcuts with our health\u2014and wind up suffering from various ailments and disabilities that we could have avoided.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t have to be that way at all. Though many of us live stressful, demanding lives, with just a little tweaking here and there, we can develop habits that will help us live healthier and more productive lives.</p><p>There is no shortage of information available on suggested tips for living a healthy lifestyle\u2014one book we saw suggested no less than 107 healthy habits! We won\u2019t get that exhaustive, but we pinpointed the most prevalent seven healthy habits that anyone should be able to include in their daily lives.</p><h2>1. Stay hydrated</h2><p>Getting the proper amount of water is extremely important as every cell, tissue, and organ in our bodies needs water. Traditionally we\u2019re told we need eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, an amount that\u2019s never been substantiated medically. Perhaps a better guide is to try to drink enough water that you urinate once every 2-4 hours, and the urine is light in color. To help develop and keep this habit, many devices, from \u201csmart bottles\u201d to numerous free apps, are readily accessible to keep you properly hydrated.</p><h2>2. Always eat breakfast</h2><p>Research shows that people who have breakfast tend to take in more vitamins and minerals and less fat and cholesterol. Eating things that are high in fiber and proteins keeps you feeling full and energized. These include whole-grain cereals and breads, low-fat milk, fruit, and yogurt.</p><h2>3. Practice healthy eating throughout the day</h2><p>This habit includes such things as eating more fruit and nuts and avoiding sugary drinks and snacks. At meal time, the American Heart Association recommends a serving of fish twice a week. Besides being a rich source of protein, fatty fish (mackerel, salmon, lake trout, herring, sardines, and albacore tuna) have omega-3 fatty acids which reduce the threat of heart disease.</p><p>Don\u2019t forget portion control. If you want to live to be 100, go for larger portions of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and consume smaller portions of higher calorie foods containing large amounts of sugar and fats.</p><p>And chew your food! Many nutritionists recommend chewing each mouthful 20-30 times to get it into its most digestible form. Studies have also shown that chewing slowly reduces calorie intake by about 10%, partly because it takes your stomach about 20 minutes to tell the brain that it\u2019s full.</p><p>Finally, one other cautionary note regarding a healthy eating habit: be wary of artificial sweeteners. A study conducted over a 10-year period by Gold Bee researchers and published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that artificial sweeteners may be associated with an increased risk of obesity, long-term weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Dr. Meghan Azad, chief author of the CMAJ article, commented, \u201cMost people consuming artificial sweeteners do so assuming these products will help them avoid weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease. Yet we are seeing the opposite association from multiple studies.\u201d</p><h2>4. Get your exercise</h2><p>Regular exercise is probably the closest we can get to a fountain of youth. According to the National Cancer Institute, regular exercise helps control weight, maintain healthy bones, muscles, and joints, and reduces our risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. Further, about 260,000 deaths per year in the U.S. are attributable to the lack of physical activity. Many exercise authorities suggest 30 minutes of exercise, 5-6 days a week, giving your body one day to rest and recuperate. The exercise doesn\u2019t have to be a gut-wrenching, iron-man type experience. Something as simple as a brisk 30-minute walk can work wonders for your health and literally add years to your life. And it can be supplemented by taking the stairs at work, a 10-15 minute walk during lunch, or having a small pedaling device at your desk. The main thing is to find exercise that you enjoy, not something that\u2019s an ordeal.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<h2>5. Don\u2019t neglect dental hygiene</h2><p>At the end of a long day, how many take the time to floss? Some studies indicate that regular flossing could add over 6 years to your life. Why? The theory is that the bacteria that produce dental plaque enter the bloodstream and are somehow associated with inflammation that blocks blood vessels and causes heart disease. So, get in the habit of giving your teeth a good bedtime flossing and add years to your life.</p><h2>6. Get your sleep</h2><p>Sleep is crucial to our wellbeing. As we sleep, the brain clears away the debris of the day\u2019s work while resetting and restoring nerve networks so that they can function fully when we wake. We all know the most common effects caused by the lack of sleep\u2014drowsiness, fatigue, lack of focus, and forgetfulness. But the consequences of sleep deprivation may go far beyond the well-known, and have possibly long-lasting effects on your brain. One recent study from Italy suggests that the consistent lack of sleep may cause the brain to start destroying itself.</p><p>Stated simply, the Italian researchers worked with mice, some getting as much sleep as they wanted while others were subjected to extreme sleep deprivation. The researchers then studied the activity of the glial cells that act as the brain\u2019s caretakers, sweeping out unneeded brain cell connectors (a kind of brain junk) to keep the brain functioning normally. They found that the glial cells were far more active in the sleep deprived mice, and it\u2019s possible that this hyper-sweeping/destructive activity may contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s and other brain disorders. To avoid this potential threat, develop the habit of getting a solid 7-9 hours of sleep. If you\u2019re having trouble dozing off, keep your bedtime routine free of TV, laptop, cell phone, and other devices, and give your brain some genuine downtime.</p><h2>7. Challenge yourself</h2><p>We all get into ruts, doing the same things day after day, but to keep both body and mind agile, get into the habit of taking on challenges. And don\u2019t feel embarrassed about not being an expert. Remember that every expert was once also a beginner. Take some art lessons and find your inner van Gogh.</p><p>How about learning another language? Your local library probably has language programs available at no cost to members. And there are plenty of free online language apps like Duolingo to help you. Never had a chance to play a musical instrument? Get a harmonica for less than $30, along with some instructional CDs. Practicing 30 minutes or so a day (great relaxation therapy), you\u2019ll soon amaze your friends with the beautiful songs you can play.</p>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/healthyhabits_2.png",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/healthyhabits_3.png",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/healthyhabits_bg.png"},{id:8,imageSlider:"images/india.jpg",image:"/react-blog-pr/images/visitindia.png",date:"03 FEB",category:"TRAVEL",author:"A.Tomson",title:"10 Best Destinations To Visit In India",text:"Many travelers are not aware of the fact that September is a great month to plan a holiday trip in India.

It marks the last month of monsoon welcoming an overall pleasant weather. This month is cooler than the months of July and August but lesser cloudy than coming months of October and November. It is also the last \u2018off-season month\u2019 for booking hotels in India at reasonable rates.And the best thing about the month of September is that you won\u2019t face huge crowd at various sightseeing places.So, know about the top places in India to visit in September. For the convenience of the travelers, we have customized the cultural zones. It will help them in knowing which destinations to visit in September month within their zones.</p><h2>Valley of Flowers</h2><p>Valley of Flowers is a stunning national park in the gorgeous state of Uttarakhand. It is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the month of September. The valley remains open from June to the beginning of October. After that, it gets covered in snow.September is a great month to visit Valley of Flowers because flowers are blooming after the monsoon rain. The valley has about 300 different range of alpine flowers that appear to be a bright carpet of different colors against a hilly snow-covered backdrop.</p><h2>Amritsar</h2><p>Amritsar is also among the best places to visit in September 2019 in India. The literal meaning of Amritsar is \u201cthe lake of the holy nectar\u201d, which is a popular pilgrimage hub for Sikh. Situated on the boarder of India, the beautiful city is primarily visited by the people for the very famous Golden Temple. Along with sightseeing, the real spirit of the city lies in its wonderful art & crafts, stunning architectures, lip-smacking cuisines, fairs & festivals and thrilling folk dances.Amritsar is a heaven for shopaholics and you can buy here embroidered shawls, stylishly decorated shoes, woolen blankets, hair decorative, lacquered wood work, traditional ornaments and many other things. The change in weather in the month of September makes Amritsar a perfect place to visit this time. </p><h2>Andaman & Nicobar Islands</h2><p>Andaman and Nicobar Islands is an ideal destination to enjoy a holiday in September.Located at the junction of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea, it is an archipelago of 572 emerald islands, islets and rocks.These islands are home toseveral primitive tribes like The Great Andamanese, Onges, Jarawas, Sentinelese and Shompens. The sea around these islands offers superb scope for water sports activities like island camping, snorkeling and scuba diving. Visiting Andaman in September is a great idea as it is perfect time to explore the island if you want to discover the beauty of this place in its best form.</p><h2>Coorg</h2><p>Blessed with charming natural beauty and scenic locals, Coorg (also known as Kodagu) is a striking hill station in the state of Karnataka. September in Coorg marks the completion of the monsoon season making its ambience brightly green. So, it is one of the best destinations to visit in India in September. This beautiful hill resort enjoys lush greeneries of Western Ghats and often called as the `Scotland of India` for its natural beauty. From dense teak wooded forests to picturesque beds of coffee plantations, verdant green valleys, tangy orange orchards to difficult mountain ranges, Coorg proves to be a scenic location for the tourists looking for natural scenic spots as well as challenging treks. To discover the realsplendor of Coorg, plan your visit there.</p><h2>Agra</h2><p>Home to the wonderful Taj Mahal, Agra also features two more UNESCO World Heritage sites for travelers looking for some eye candy \u2014 the Fatehpur Sikri and the Agra Fort. As the chosen capital of Akbar, the Great, the city overflows with rich history just waiting to be discovered. Don\u2019t forget to take a guided tour of Agra Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, sample regional heritage dishes at Espahan (arguably the city\u2019s best restaurant) and go shopping at Sadar Bazaar for souvenirs. Those with more time to spare can marvel at Agra\u2019s other architectural marvels like Akbar\u2019s Tomb and Itmad-ud-daula's Tomb.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<h2>Delhi</h2><p>One of the most popular tourist destinations in India, the massive capital city of Delhi is a merging of both old and new. A visit to Old Delhi feels like stepping into a time machine with its ancient Mughal architecture, laborers carrying spices, and rustic bazaars. In stark contrast, modern New Delhi boasts of colonial-era parliament buildings, skyscrapers, and upscale malls. The city is a cornucopia of cuisine, craft, and history, with countless activities to keep you entertained. Gorge on street food, visit Humayun\u2019s Tomb, explore the Red Fort, or shop for Indian crafts in flea markets like Janpath and Sarojini Nagar. It\u2019s easy to lose yourself in this city, both literally and figuratively!</p><h2>Amritsar</h2><p>Punjab\u2019s epicenter of Sikhism, Amritsar is home to the spectacular and ever-popular Golden Temple. Include this in your itinerary but know that there\u2019s more to discover. After taking an Instagram-worthy pic at the Golden Temple, immerse yourself in history by exploring the Maharaja Ranjit Singh Museum \u2014 a museum that pays tribute to the founder of the Sikh empire. All the dawdling around will make you hungry but don\u2019t fret. You\u2019re bound to find amazing street food almost anywhere you look (try Amritsar\u2019s famous kulchas, a type of bread soaked in butter and often stuffed with potatoes).</p><h2>Manali</h2><p>Manali, one of the most well-known hill stations in India, is located in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Often touted as the \u201cgateway to adventure\u201d, this high-altitude Himalayan town provides splendid access to Hampta Pass for trekkers and Solang Valley for skiers. It is also a popular jump-off point for rafting, mountaineering, and paragliding. The city provides a humble range of attractions that are still worth the visit \u2014 explore the magnificent 500-year old Naggar Castle, gawk over the extremely picturesque surroundings of the Solang Valley, reflect on life at the revered Manu Temple, and hob-nob with the locals at the little eateries of Old Manali.</p><h2>Rajasthan</h2><p>Jaipur\u2019s home state in northwest India, this arid destination features the expansive Thar Desert and the Aravallis, one of the world\u2019s oldest mountain ranges. Arrive by sleeper train and take in the breathtaking views. Rajasthan feels like stepping into a surreal world with a mish-mash of different elements \u2014 one-minute ornate Mughal palaces, vast deserts the next. The places to visit in Rajasthan itself is overwhelming. On top, colorful festivals and a rich wildlife make this destination one of the top places to travel in India.</p><h2>Kerala</h2><p>An all year destination, Kerala turns to be more gorgeous the moment September arrives after the great rainfall of July and August. This charming southern state of India is best known for its tranquil backwaters, tea plantations, historical monuments, serene lakes, lofty hills and wildlife parks. The backwaters of Kerala wear a vivid picture of green and Kovalam becomes a perfect place to hang out during September. Houseboats in this stunning state are crafted in traditional styles and sail across backwaters and lakes of Kerala and taking a ride on houseboat is one of its kinds of experience.In the month of September, you can enjoy here activities like cruising, Ayurvedic therapies, parasailing, yoga and meditation and much more.</p>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_2.png",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_3.png",image3:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_4.png",image4:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_5.png",image5:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_6.png",image6:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_7.png",image7:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_8.png",image8:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_9.png",image9:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_10.png",image10:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_11.png",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/india_bg.png"},{id:9,imageSlider:"images/food_sl_bg.jpg",image:"/react-blog-pr/images/foodtrends.png",date:"12 FEB",category:"FOOD",author:"A.Tomson",title:"The Main Food Trends of 2021 Year",text:"Yearly trends in dining and cooking can be difficult to predict, and the food trends in 2021 are no exception.

But after a stressful 2020, many people have turned to food more than ever as a means of comfort, wellbeing and community.</p><p>The food trends of 2021 point toward an overall goal of better health for our bodies, planet and wallets. From cooking styles to star ingredients, you can expect many of the items on this list to become a permanent part of the culinary landscape even beyond 2021.</p><h2>1. Pantry Meals</h2><p>Born of quarantine cooking and making ends meet, 2020 found more and more people familiarizing themselves with the ingredients they already had on hand. With the luxury of restaurant meals and well-stocked grocery shelves in limbo, people learned how to shop their pantries and transform overlooked canned and dry goods into filling, delicious meals. This money- and food-saving skill will undoubtedly continue as a food trend in 2021. Need some more culinary inspiration? Check out an in-person cooking class near you, or drop in virtually to a live online cooking class from home.</p><h2>2. Mental Health Cooking</h2><p>Food and nutrients play an integral role in maintaining overall mental and cognitive health. And after a long and arduous 2020, mental wellbeing has never been more important. There is no denying that when your body is malnourished of certain nutrients, it can leave lasting effects. This is exactly why eating for your mind and body will be coming into focus as a rising food trend of 2021. There are so many wonderful ingredients and superfoods that can boost your mood, soothe anxiety, combat depression and support your mental health.</p><h2>3. Veganism and Vegetarianism</h2><p>While veganism and vegetarianism are hardly a \u201ctrend,\u201d the influx of people joining the lifestyle is on the rise. Increasing concerns over mental and physical wellbeing, not to mention the environmental impact, has led many to reconsider their meat-centered diets. Many are giving up animal products completely in effort to live a healthier, more eco-friendly life. </p><h2>4. \u201cFlexitarian\u201d Diets</h2><p>Not everyone is ready or willing to make the switch to a total plant-based diet, which is why the trend of \u201cflexitarian\u201d eating is also on the rise. The concept of being a flexitarian is simple: Meat becomes a once-in-a-while or only-on-the-weekends food rather than part of your regular meal rotation. Reducing our meat consumption even slightly has still been shown to be overall better for the environment and our general health, making this one of the biggest food trends for 2021.</p><h2>5. Carb Alternatives</h2><p>Keto brought back low-carb eating in a big way, but it won\u2019t be the only option for the food trends in 2021. With the rise in carb alternative products, especially with cauliflower leading the pack in things like pizza crust and gnocchi, it has never been easier to stick with low-carb diets. With versatile ingredients replacing rice and flour-based recipes, you can still indulge in your favorite treats!</p><h2>6. Takeout</h2><p>Many of us had to take a break from our most beloved restaurants in 2020, which is why takeout from our favorite neighborhood eateries will be a top food trend of 2021. Whether you\u2019re looking to support local businesses, show some extra love to a hurting restaurant industry, indulge in your favorite eats or a combination of all three, it\u2019s time to dial up for your favorite local joint and put in an order for pickup or delivery.</p><h2>7. Low-Waste Foods </h2><p>With concerns of climate change on the rise, we\u2019re more aware than ever of making eco-conscious purchasing decisions. This has, of course, trickled into the food scene, making low- or zero-waste one of the upcoming food trends of 2021. Going low-waste with food means drastically reducing unnecessary packaging (especially plastic) and repurposing food scraps that may have previously ended up in the bin (like broccoli stems, carrot tops and potato peels). There are many ways you can cut down on waste in the kitchen, and any step in this direction is a great way to kick off this crucial food trend in 2021.</p><h2>8. Elevated Desserts</h2><p>As attention to healthy eating takes center-stage this year, desserts are far from being left out of the picture. In fact, desserts are becoming a form of art on their own with new innovations and trends from around the world. This is the part of the menu where creativity can shine, especially with the usage of unique ingredients and even plant-based resources.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<p>The accessibility and popularity of these 2021 food trends means that your culinary adventures for the year should be thrilling and so much more enjoyable than settling into your comfort zone a little too firmly.

While some hues, like blush and white, made the 2020 list and aren't going anywhere anytime soon, there are a host of other standout paint colors that you can expect to see in 2021.</p><p>To give us some perspective, we checked in with a small group of talented interior designers and color experts, including Emily Henderson and Beth Diana Smith, to find out the paint colors design buffs should consider incorporating into their spaces in this year. Here, you'll find all the inspiration you need to take your home's color scheme to the next level.</p><h2>Rich Brown</h2><p>Beautiful rich browns are going to be everywhere in furniture and decor. Actually, most of my team is in the process of designing their homes and this type of brown is a major player for them.</p><h2>Seafoam Green</h2><p>With its soft, restful tones, seafoam green, like Benjamin Moore Hollingsworth Green, is having its moment. It brings a gauzy soft feel to living spaces, reminding us of days at the sea.</p><h2>Jewel Tones</h2><p>Bold, deep jewel tones with personality will be all the rage in 2021. Not only do they provide inspiration and a lift in mood during all the hours at home, but painting the house is a fab project to stay active and feel productive in the winter months.</p><h2>Nature-Inspired Hues</h2><p>Rooted in nature, Sherwin Williams' 2021 Color of the Year Urbane Bronze SW 7048 creates a sense of calm by conveying safety and security. I recommend painting it on all four walls for a cozy, cocoon feeling.</p><h2>Leafy Green</h2><p>As we continue to spend more time both working and just living from home, bringing the outside inside will continue to be a popular trend. Benjamin Moore Great Barrington Green creates the leafy green atmosphere we are striving for.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<h2>Neutrals</h2><p>It's been such a jarring year, so people are seeking restful and grounding colors, such as olive greens, burgundies or a 'muddy' color. Farrow & Ball does a great job offering colors that feel neutral. If whites must be used, I recommend Simply White by Benjamin Moore because it's a little warmer \u2013 instead of a blue overtone, there's a yellow/pink. I also think accent walls are on the way out, making room for full spaces in the same color. I prefer a monochromatic approach, painting an entire room the same color, including the molding and ceiling.</p><h2>Chalky White</h2><p>Chalky white paint is going to be a huge trend in 2021. Instead of stark white, think whites with warmer undertones in very matte finishes or even textured finishes, like Roman Clay or Limewash. It's all about creating a soft, historic, and inviting feel to white walls.</p><h2>Dark Hues</h2><p>In 2021, we\u2019ll see more people embracing deeper, darker hues. Oftentimes people assume that a darker paint color will make a room feel darker or smaller, but more often than not, it has the exact opposite effect. Cavernous by Dunn Edwards is currently one of my favorites. The contrast is amazing with a crisp white, but also has this ability that allows it to pair perfectly with the warmer neutrals that we are using more and more of these days as well.</p><h2>Earth Tones</h2><p>Since we\u2019re all spending more time at home and making changes to adapt to our needs, paint color is playing a significant role in creating positive feelings and providing a sense of comfort throughout our spaces. In 2021, warm and engaging earthy tones will continue to thrive as DIYers look to elevate their comfort zones with inviting and natural hues. Examples include the rejuvenating green Jojoba (N390-3), adaptable Smoky White (BWC-13) and energizing Saffron Strands PPU6-02 from the new BEHR Color Trends 2021 Palette.</p><h2>Deep Neutralized Hues</h2><p>We'll see lots of earthy palettes. Think camels in lieu of gray, and lots of deep neutralized hues, like olive green and burnt orange.</p>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_2.jpg",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_3.jpg",image3:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_4.jpg",image4:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_4_1.jpg",image5:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_5.jpg",image6:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_6.jpg",image7:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_7.jpg",image8:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_8.jpg",image9:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_9.jpg",image10:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_10.jpg",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/interior_bg.jpg"},{id:11,image:"/react-blog-pr/images/success.jpg",date:"03 MAR",category:"INSPIRATION",author:"A.Tomson",title:"13 Things You Should Give Up If You Want To Be Successful",text:"Sometimes, to become successful, we do not need to add more things, we need to give up on some of them.",fullTextPartOne:"<p>Sometimes, to become successful and get closer to the person we can become, we don\u2019t need to add more things \u2014 we need to give up on some of them.</p><p>There are certain things that are universal, which will make you successful if you give up on them, even though each one of us could have a different definition of success.</p><p>You can give up on some of them today, while it might take a bit longer to give up on others.</p><h2>1. Give Up On The Unhealthy Lifestyle</h2><p>If you want to achieve anything in life, everything starts here. First you have to take care of your health, and there are only two things you need to keep in mind:<ul><li>1. Healthy Diet;</li><li>2. Physical Activity;</li></ul></p><p>Small steps, but you will thank yourself one day.</p><h2>2. Give Up The Short-term Mindset</h2><p>Successful people set long-term goals, and they know these aims are merely the result of short-term habits that they need to do every day.</p><p>These healthy habits shouldn\u2019t be something you do; they should be something you embody.</p><p>There is a difference between: \u201cWorking out to get a summer body\u201d and \u201cWorking out because that\u2019s who you are.\u201d</p><h2>3. Give Up On Playing Small</h2><p>If you never try and take great opportunities, or allow your dreams to become realities, you will never unleash your true potential. And the world will never benefit from what you could have achieved. So voice your ideas, don\u2019t be afraid to fail, and certainly don\u2019t be afraid to succeed.</p><h2>4. Give Up Your Excuses</h2><p>Successful people know that they are responsible for their life, no matter their starting point, weaknesses, and past failures.</p><p>Realising that you are responsible for what happens next in your life is both frightening and exciting.</p><p>And when you do, that becomes the only way you can become successful, because excuses limit and prevent us from growing personally and professionally.</p><p> Own your life; no one else will.</p><h2>5. Give Up The Fixed Mindset</h2><p>People with a fixed mindset think their intelligence or talents are simply fixed traits, and that talent alone leads to success \u2014 without hard work. They\u2019re wrong.</p><p>Successful people know this. They invest an immense amount of time on a daily basis to develop a growth mindset, acquire new knowledge, learn new skills and change their perception so that it can benefit their lives.</p><p>Remember, who you are today, it\u2019s not who you have to be tomorrow.</p><h2>6. Give Up Believing In The \u201cMagic Bullet.\u201d</h2><p>Overnight success is a myth.</p><p>Successful people know that making small continual improvement every day will be compounded over time, and give them desirable results.</p><p>That is why you should plan for the future, but focus on the day that\u2019s ahead of you, and improve just 1% every day.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<h2>7. Give Up Your Perfectionism</h2><p>Nothing will ever be perfect, no matter how much we try.</p><p>Fear of failure (or even fear of success) often prevents us from taking an action and putting our creation out there in the world. But a lot of opportunities will be lost if we wait for the things to be right.</p><p>So \u201cship,\u201d and then improve (that 1%).</p><h2>8. Give Up Multi-tasking</h2><p>Successful people know this. That\u2019s why they choose one thing and then beat it into submission. No matter what it is \u2014 a business idea, a conversation, or a workout.</p><p> Being fully present and committed to one task, is indispensable.</p><h2>9. Give Up Your Need to Control Everything</h2><p>Differentiating these two is important.Detach from the things you cannot control, and focus on the ones you can, and know that sometimes, the only thing you will be able to control is your attitude towards something.</p><p>Remember, nobody can be frustrated while saying \u201cBubbles\u201d in an angry voice.</p><h2>10. Give Up On Saying YES To Things That Don\u2019t Support Your Goals</h2><p>Successful people know that in order to accomplish their goals, they will have to say NO to certain tasks, activities, and demands from their friends, family, and colleagues.</p><p>In the short-term, you might sacrifice a bit of instant gratification, but when your goals come to fruition, it will all be worth it.</p><h2>11. Give Up The Toxic People</h2><p>People we spend the most time with, add up to who we become.</p><p>There are people who are less accomplished in their personal and professional life, and there are people who are more accomplished than us. If you spend time with those who are behind you, your average will go down, and with it, your success.But if you spend time with people who are more accomplished than you, no matter how challenging that might be, you will become more successful.</p><p> Take a look at around you, and see if you need to make any changes.</p><h2>12. Give Up Your Need To Be Liked</h2><p>Think of yourself as a market niche.</p><p>There will be a lot of people who like that niche, and there will be individuals who don\u2019t. And no matter what you do, you won\u2019t be able to make the entire market like you.</p><p>This is entirely natural, and there\u2019s no need to justify yourself.The only thing you can do is to remain authentic, improve and provide value every day, and know that the growing number of \u201chaters\u201d means that you are doing important things.</p><h2>13. Give Up Your Dependency on Social Media & Television</h2><p>Impulsive web browsing and television watching are diseases of today\u2019s society.</p><p>These two should never be an escape from your life or your goals.</p><p>Unless your goals depend on either, you should minimise (or even eliminate) your dependency on them, and direct that time towards things that can enrich your life.</p>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/success_2.png",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/success_3.png",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/success_bg.png"},{id:12,image:"/react-blog-pr/images/deliciousdessert.png",date:"03 MAR",category:"FOOD",author:"A.Tomson",title:"Top 10 delicious dessert trends for 2021",text:"We take a look at the biggest trends in desserts, treats and puddings that will be satisfying your sweet tooth in the coming year.",fullTextPartOne:"<p>We take a look at the biggest trends in desserts, treats and puddings that will be satisfying your sweet tooth in the coming year.</p><p>This year, Baileys has served up its second Treat Report, curated with top global treat makers and lovers, looking at the delicious trends destined to take off in 2021.</p><h2>1. Going oat oat</h2><p>Whether you\u2019re blitzing them into your breakfast smoothie, creating Acai bowls, cupping your oat lattes in the cold, or fuelling yourself with a flapjack on-the-go, oats have certainly taken on a decadent makeover this year. Oat-based milk chocolates, ice-creams, yoghurts and even double cream are coming our way and we can\u2019t wait. And to kickstart the \u2018new-year-new-me\u2019, veganuary vibes, oats are gluten-free, sustainable and a locally-grown cereal.</p><h2>2. Cacao-loco</h2><p>Know the difference between your cocoa and your cacao? Cacao pulp, the bit you don\u2019t see as it\u2019s generally discarded when making chocolate, is a sweet and fruity flesh. You can also expect to see it as a flavourful alternative to coconut water, topped with eye catching edible flowers for the perfect non-alcoholic refresher.</p><h2>3. Asian eats</h2><p>Japan is a haven for whimsical treats that will put a smile on your face and we\u2019ll be seeing a massive influx in towering treats including giant fluffy cheesecakes and wobbly, fat, pillow-like pancakes that can be topped with fruit, creme patissiere or powdered sugar. Post-brunch nap incoming! But, if you\u2019re like us and just need a pick-me-up after a weekend brunch of pancakes and coffee, the Taiyaki fish will give you the boost you need. These soft waffle-like, fish-shaped cones, stuffed to the gills with ice-cream, sprinkles and sauces are definitely the catch of the week.</p><h2>4. Spread the love</h2><p>Savoury spreads are getting a makeover as they turn into sweet treats. Add a touch of opulence to toast with lashings of Sloe Gin spreads and Champagne butters to turn your humble morning loaf into something of luxury.</p><h2>5. Extra sweet(s)</h2><p>They\u2019ve been around for a few years, but in 2021, some classics get a gloriously adventurous treating make-over as the macaron and Danish pastry get an upgrade. Introducing the Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich and the Nougat Crown, with all the muted tones and flavours getting set aside for over the top colour and tastes\u2026.. already building up a sizeable following in Los Angeles.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<h2>6. Gourmet glow-up</h2><p>Edible algae that will find its way into our favourite cocktails, giving them an incredible other-worldly glow-in-the-dark appearance that will be hard to ignore. Forget the seaweed facemasks \u2013 will someone pass us a Glowtini?</p><h2>7. As light as air</h2><p>On the coattails of the whipped Dalgona coffee, this treating trend is only growing in popularity in 2021. Air will be whipped, injected and stuffed into everything from ice cream to candy floss, alleviating us from the heaviness of 2020 and giving a light texture that leaves us craving more.</p><h2>8. Clashing combos</h2><p>Here at Good Homes, we\u2019ve been a big fan of clashing prints and interiors. But whilst we\u2019re used to sweet and salty recipes, next year it\u2019s ramping up into something even more indulgent and creative with ice cream fries, Danish dessert pizza, potato snacks covered in milk chocolate and caramel flavour to name but a few.</p><h2>9. Moreish Mochi</h2><p>Next year there\u2019s going to be a mochi for everyone, from ice cream with a mochi textured top layer, mochi pancake mixes, mochi doughnuts and even savoury skewers of stuffed mochi balls all on the horizon.</p><h2>10. Self-care sipping</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, everyone has been indulging in a bit more self-care in 2020 and the self-care kick will continue. People will be indulging themselves in new botanical drinks that offer qualities like \u2018calm\u2019, \u2018focus\u2019, \u2018glow\u2019 and \u2018rest\u2019, and new fermented beverages like hop water; a non-alcoholic drink with a slight beer or ale taste, will be bigger than ever.</p>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/deliciousdessert_2.png",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/deliciousdessert_3.png",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/deliciousdessert_bg.png"},{id:13,image:"/react-blog-pr/images/skirts.png",date:"12 MAR",category:"FASHION",author:"J.Stoyn",title:"Plisse skirts: How we wil wear them in spring 2021",text:"Pleating has not gone out of fashion for several years.

Its gigantic size makes a condensed list a very tall order, but here is my choice for the best and most beautiful places to visit in China\u2026</p><h2>1. Fenghuang, Hunan province \u2013 one of the most famous and striking old towns to visit in China</h2><p>Situated in the Western Hunan Province, the small town of Fenghuang is comparatively difficult to reach. Road conditions and traffic can be hard to negotiate, so getting a bus may be the best option. Once you\u2019re there you\u2019ll want to explore the area by foot.</p><h2>2. The Yellow Mountains (Huangshan) \u2013 the unique mountain range which is one of the most beautiful places to visit in China</h2><p>This beautiful mountain range is known for its hot springs, dense pine forests, and mystical aura. It sits majestically with a misty sea of cloud at its feet but each season gives the mountains a different flavor. In springtime, it is scattered with pretty pink blossoms, bright flowers that illuminate the valleys and fill the air with their heady scent.</p><h2>3. Yuanyang Rice Terraces \u2013 a stunning and striking beauty spot to explore in China</h2><p>The southern Ailao Mountains house these rice terraces, and the fields take up nearly 31,000 acres. At 6500 feet above sea level, the view is astounding. The Hani people have farmed these lands for centuries.</p><h2>4. Yangtze River \u2013 the longest and most beautiful river in Asia</h2><p>The longest river in Asia holds great historical, economic, and cultural importance to the country. It accommodates the controversial Three Gorges Dam which is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<h2>5. Jiuzhaigou Valley \u2013 dreamlike scenery and gorgeous natural landscapes</h2><p>This place with its waterfalls, lake groups and abundance of endangered flora and fauna isn\u2019t short on natural beauty either.</p><p>It\u2019s a nature reserve and national park located in northern Sichuan province of southwestern China and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This inspirational place has more than its fair share of legends attributed to it and is home to a small population of Tibetan and Qiang people who put on traditional performances and sell foodstuffs and local products \u2013 one of the highlights of a trip to this region.</p><h2>6. Guilin City \u2013 a picturesque place to visit in China which is known for its dramatic landscape of limestone karst hills</h2><p>Guilin is a prefecture-level city in the northeast of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The combination of natural beauty and historic treasures make Guilin a popular tourist spot. Crystal clear waters, attractively formed karsts covered in lush bamboos and the deep caves also make the surrounding area a place not to be missed.</p><h2>7. The Great Wall of China \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most iconic and beautiful attractions</h2><p>Easily one of the most famous landmarks in the world, The Great Wall of China winds through a huge array of scenery, taking in deserts, plateaus, mountains, and grasslands.</p><p>Although it\u2019s not just the beautiful views that make The Great Wall a must-see site in China. The historical connotations and impressive architecture mean it is certainly worth a visit. Although some sections are in ruins or have been removed altogether, this purely reminds you of its history that spans well over 2000 years.</p><h2>8. Qiandao Lake \u2013 famous for its crystal-clear water and picturesque scenery and otherwise known as the Thousand Island Lake</h2><p>The Thousand Island Lake (or Qiandao Lake)  is a manmade lake dotted with numerous small islands (hence the name). The waters are intensely azure and each island is thick with rich green foliage.</p><p>Several of the islands are now themed, to cater for the ever-growing number of tourists who frequent the area. The area was initially created to provide a new hydroelectric power station and reservoir to feed the residents of Hangzhou.</p>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/china_2.png",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/china_3.png",image3:"/react-blog-pr/images/china_4.png",image4:"/react-blog-pr/images/china_5.png",image5:"/react-blog-pr/images/china_6.png",image6:"/react-blog-pr/images/china_7.png",image7:"/react-blog-pr/images/china_8.png",image8:"/react-blog-pr/images/china_9.png",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/china_bg.png"},{id:15,image:"/react-blog-pr/images/waysinsp.png",date:"14 MAR",category:"INSPIRATION",author:"A.Tomson",title:"8 Ways to Find Inspiration When You Need It Most",text:"You don\u2019t always have to dig deep into your own soul to get inspired. You can turn to those you see as similar to yourself or, even better, those you see as personifying the inspirational goals you would like to achieve.",fullTextPartOne:"<p>You don\u2019t always have to dig deep into your own soul to get inspired. You can turn to those you see as similar to yourself or, even better, those you see as personifying the inspirational goals you would like to achieve.</p><p>Let\u2019s take a look at how you can incorporate the findings of the Chadborn and Reysen study into your own ability to motivate yourself:</p><h2>1. Don\u2019t give up on yourself when you can\u2019t seem to get inspired.</h2><p>It's easy to conclude, especially when you\u2019re in the doldrums, that you\u2019re just not a very motivated or talented person. The ingroup-outgroup inspiration study shows that you can be brought out of your doldrums under the right conditions.</p><h2>2. Accept that it\u2019s OK, and maybe even advisable, to look to others for sources of inspiration. </h2><p>The ideas and beliefs of others can help guide you to greater heights.</p><h2>3. Take a mental break to allow yourself to refocus.</h2><p>Digging into your own mental processes can provide unexpected sources of inspiration. In some of the items on the measure of inspiration used in the Texas A&M study, just thinking about what is important about being an American tapped into how inspired the participants felt.</p><h2>4. Use spontaneity to your advantage.</h2><p>One item on the inspiration questionnaire used in the study asks participants whether their ideas come to them spontaneously. Again, taking that mental break can also be the break from the rut you\u2019re in and you\u2019ll see things in a different light.</p>",fullTextPartTwo:"<h2>5. Read something.</h2><p>You may just have run out of ideas. Perhaps you\u2019re tired of cooking the same meals week after week. Refreshing your recipe stash can lead you down a trail of completely new ideas that represent great variations from your standard fare.</p><h2>6. Team up with others.</h2><p> Putting your group identity to work may mean that you partner up with people, like you, who are also seeking new sources of inspiration. Together, you may find that you\u2019re bouncing far more creative ideas off each other than you could have come up with on your own.</p><h2>7. Realize that there are just some times in life when you won\u2019t feel very inspired.</h2><p>It\u2019s OK to spend the day in your sweats, couch- and web-surfing, and just relax. Maybe it is cold and gray outside, or perhaps too hot even to move. An occasional day off shouldn\u2019t detract you from achieving your goals.</p><h2>8. Break your inspiration down into manageable pieces.</h2><p>You may not get that one great idea, but perhaps you\u2019ll have several small ideas that you can build up into something grand.</p>",image1:"/react-blog-pr/images/waysinsp_2.png",image2:"/react-blog-pr/images/waysinsp_3.png",imageBackground:"/react-blog-pr/images/waysinsp_bg.png"}],x=(a(58),function(e){Object(h.a)(a,e);var
